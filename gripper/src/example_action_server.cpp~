// member initialization list describes how to initialize member as_

//  
// Syntax of naming the function to be invoked: get a pointer to the function, called executeCB, which is a member method
// of our class exampleActionServer.  Since this is a class method, we need to tell boost::bind that it is a class member,
// using the "this" keyword.  the _1 argument says that our executeCB takes one argument
// the final argument  "false" says don't start the server yet.  (We'll do this in the constructor)

// actionlib is the package for action servers

// <example_action_server::demoAction> customizes the simple action server to use our own "action" message 
// defined in our package, "example_action_server", in the subdirectory "action", called "demo.action"
// The name "demo" is prepended to other message types created automatically during compilation.
// e.g.,  "demoAction" is auto-generated from (our) base name "demo" and generic name "Action"
